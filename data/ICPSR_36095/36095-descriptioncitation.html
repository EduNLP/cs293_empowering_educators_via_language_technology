		        		<h2>Project Description:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Summary:</strong> The National Center for Teacher Effectiveness Main Study (NCTE) encompasses three years of data collection and observations of math instruction in approximately 50 schools and 300 classrooms. Data were collected from classroom observations, student assessments, and teacher surveys. Teacher background information includes number of years of experience, education, race, and gender. Student respondent demographic and household information includes race, gender, household makeup, free and reduced lunch status, English proficiency, number of books in the household, and number of rooms in the home.</span></p>

		        		<h2>Methodology:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Sample:</strong> NCTE partnered with 4 public school districts, which were chosen due to prior established relationships. The study targeted 4th and 5th grade math teachers from all public schools where principals agreed to allow for the randomization of class rosters to teachers in year 3 of the study. Teachers were recruited from schools where there were at least 2 or more math teachers in either 4th or 5th grade.</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Time Method:</strong> Cross-sectional</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Universe:</strong> Elementary (4th and 5th Grade) math teachers and students.</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Unit(s) of Observation:</strong> individual</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Data Type(s):</strong> administrative records data, observational data, survey data</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Mode of Data Collection:</strong> coded video observation, cognitive assessment test, mail questionnaire</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Response Rates:</strong> 56 percent</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Presence of Common Scales:</strong> Mathematical Knowledge for Teaching (MKT), Mathematical Quality of Instruction (MQI), Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS), Tripod Student Survey</span></p>

In addition, the original codebook has been released as separate codebooks for each respective dataset., 2016-02-10 Additional documentation, a PI-supplied technical report, has been added to the collection., <p>2015-07-02 ICPSR data undergo a confidentiality review and are altered when necessary to limit the risk of disclosure. ICPSR also routinely creates ready-to-go data files along with setups in the major statistical software formats as well as standard codebooks to accompany the data. In addition to these procedures, ICPSR performed the following processing steps for this data collection:</p><ul><li>Created variable labels and/or value labels.</li><li>Checked for undocumented or out-of-range codes.</li></ul></span></p>
