# CS 293 / EDUC 473: Empowering Educators via Language Technology

[Course Website](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs293/)

This repository contain the course assignments. 
The assignments are designed to be hosted on **Google Colab** because Colab minimizes the amount of setup needed to run the code and provides free acces to computing resources, including GPUs, which will be important for HW2.
You may of course do the assignments without Colab---however, you will be responsible for adapting the notebooks and code accordingly.
